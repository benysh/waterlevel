# waterlevel
python script to check the past, current, and projected water level of the main pool at lake zumbro, mn.
If the levels have risen in a given timeframe beyond a set threshold, then triggers an alert.
If the current level is above a warning threshold, then that triggers an alert.
If the projected level will increase or decrease beyond set thresholds, that will also trigger an alert.
All the alert items above are collected into a single email.
